0.8.25 (000120)

	files in the samples directory.

0.8.24 (000117)

0.8.20 (000106)
+ cut out dhcp server checking.. this was causing dialout ppp
	sessions with idle time set to never time out.

	was originally to stop it replying to a dhcp client
	on a NETtel which was really a bad way to do it in the
	first place :-)

0.8.19 (000104)
+ fixes for route add -host on a machine that needs to run both
	a DHCP client and server (dual eth box)

0.8.18 (991220)

+ added lease time to ACK -- doesn't work if in OFFER
+ decreased internal array clear delay to 60 seconds
