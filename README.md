**Keyonex**â„¢ - the key to scalability.

Welcome to the Keyronex repository. Keyronex is an operating system currently
targeting amd64 PCs. **It is early in development, so much of what follows is
just the plan**. The Keyronix kernel is internally structured into three
components: the nanokernel, DeviceKit, and the Portable Applications Subsystem.
These have the following functionality:

- The nanokernel implements basic primitives: scheduling, virtual memory
  management, synchronisation, and simple message-passing.
- These services are used to implement a POSIX personality by the Portable
  Applications Subsystem.
- DeviceKit implements an object-oriented driver framework in Objective-C, with
  adapters to expose relevant devices to the Portable Applications Subsystem.

All three are implemented in kernel-space and are logically distinct; the
nanokernel is only minimally dependent on the higher services, but the Portable
Applications Subsystem and DeviceKit interdepend on each other and on the
nanokernel.

Goals
-----



Building
--------

You need patched binutils and GCC installed into `/opt/x86_64-keyronex'.
Instructions in [docs/toolchain.md]().

Repeating the installation of mlibc headers into the sysroot should be
unnecessary (I hope). If it is necessary, you can do:

`meson --cross-file=amd64.ini --prefix=/usr build`
`ninja -C build`
`DESTDIR=/tmp/keyronex-sysroot ninja -C build install`

Third-party components
----------------------

Several third-party components are used. These are some of them:
- mlibc: Provides libc.
- nanoprintf: used for `kprintf`.
- FreeBSD: `queue.h`, `tree.h` generic lists and trees
<!--
 - liballoc: Provides one of the in-kernel allocators.
 - NetBSD:
  - (`kernel-3/dev/fbterm/nbsdbold.psfu`): Bold8x16 font used for FBTerminal.
  - (`kernel-3/dev/nvmereg.h`): NVMe register definitions.
 - Solaris (`kernel-3/dev/fbterm/sun12x22.psfu`): Sun Demi Gallant font available
  for FBTerminal
 - ObjFW: provides an Objective-C runtime.
 - limine/`limine-terminal-port` (some files in`kernel-3/dev/fbterm/`) used by
  FBTerminal to provide a terminal.
 - LUX ACPI Implementation (`kernel-3/dev/acpi/lai`): ACPI mplementation from
  Managarm used by Acpi* drivers.
 - LZ4 (`kernel-3/libkern/lz4.{c,h}`): Used by VM Compressor to ompress pages.
 - libuuid (`kernel-3/libkern/uuid*`)
- Linux (`kernel-3/ext2fs/ext2_fs.h`): Ext2 filesystem definitions
